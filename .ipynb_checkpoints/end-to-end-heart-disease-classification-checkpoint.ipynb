    "# Predicting heart disease using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based ML and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to take following approach:\n",
    "1. Problem definition (classification/regression problem?) \n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation (what defines success, what target we pursue)\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modelling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement:\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about the patient can we predict whether or not they have heart disease -> i.e. Binary Classification Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came from the Cleavland data from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease). There is also a version available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at whether or not patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Create data dictionary**\n",
    "1. age - age in years\n",
    "2. sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)\n",
    "3. cp - chest pain type\n",
    "    * 0: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart\n",
    "    * 1: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart\n",
    "    * 2: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)\n",
    "    * 3: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease\n",
    "4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "    * anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern\n",
    "5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "    * serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides\n",
    "    * above 200 is cause for concern\n",
    "6. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "    * '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes\n",
    "7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "    * 0: Nothing to note\n",
    "    * 1: ST-T Wave abnormality\n",
    "        * can range from mild symptoms to severe problems\n",
    "        * signals non-normal heart beat\n",
    "    * 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy\n",
    "        * Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber\n",
    "8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
    "10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "    * looks at stress of heart during excercise\n",
    "    * unhealthy heart will stress more\n",
    "11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "    * 0: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon)\n",
    "    * 1: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)\n",
    "    * 2: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart\n",
    "12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n",
    "    * colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through\n",
    "    * the more blood movement the better (no clots)\n",
    "13. thal - thalium stress result\n",
    "    * 1,3: normal\n",
    "    * 6: fixed defect: used to be defect but ok now\n",
    "    * 7: reversable defect: no proper blood movement when excercising\n",
    "14. target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no) (= the predicted attribute)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: No personal identifiable information (PPI) can be found in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to save these to a Python dictionary or in an external file, so we can look at them later without coming back here."
